# Librum-Server
The Librum-Server includes the API, database, and other fundamental infrastructure required for the "backend" of all Librum client applications and the website.

The server is written in C# using ASP.NET Core. The codebase can be developed, built, run, and deployed cross-platform on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

# Self-hosting

Librum-Server can easily be self-hosted. This way all your data and books remain on your own devices and are not synchronized to the official cloud.<br>
You can find the instructions on how to self-host Librum-Server [here](self-hosting/self-host-installation.md).
